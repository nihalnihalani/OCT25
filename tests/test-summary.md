### 4. Key Test Validations

#### Test Case Matrix Examples

| Persona | Purchase | Price | Expected | Actual Formula | Pass |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|----------------|------|
| Student Sarah | Groceries | $150 | Buy | Necessity=9, Freq=8 | ✅ |
| Student Sarah | Gaming Console | $500 | Don't Buy | Afford=0, Goal=3 | ✅ |
| Henry | Luxury Watch | $3,000 | Don't Buy | OpCost≤4, Risk≤5 | ✅ |
| Henry | Home Gym | $1,500 | Buy | Afford≥6, Freq=10 | ✅ |
| Barbara | Stock Platform | $100 | Buy | Goal=9, Afford=10 | ✅ |
| Barbara | Impulse Art | $800 | Don't Buy | Emotional=2, Freq=3 | ✅ |

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies Added
- jest@29.7.0
- @babel/core, @babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-react
- ts-jest for TypeScript support
- @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM testing
- jest-environment-jsdom for browser simulation

#### Configuration Files
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration with coverage thresholds
- `.babelrc` - Babel configuration for ES6+ support
- `tests/setup.js` - Global mocks and test utilities

#### Test Scripts Added
```json
"test": "jest"
"test:watch": "jest --watch"
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
"test:unit": "jest tests/unit"
"test:integration": "jest tests/integration"
"test:verbose": "jest --verbose"
```

### 6. Formula Verification

#### Core Calculations Tested:
```javascript
monthlyNetIncome = income - expenses - debt
emergencyFundMonths = savings / (expenses + debt)
debtToIncomeRatio = (debt / income) * 100
hasEmergencyFund = emergencyFundMonths >= 3
```

#### Decision Matrix Weights:
- **Low Risk**: Financial 40%, Utility 27%, Psychological 18%, Risk 15%
- **Moderate**: Financial 40%, Utility 30%, Psychological 20%, Risk 10%
- **High Risk**: Financial 40%, Utility 32%, Psychological 21%, Risk 7%

### 7. Test Execution

To run tests:
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage report
npm run test:unit          # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Run integration tests only
```

### 8. Coverage Goals

Target coverage thresholds configured:
- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Lines: 70%
- Statements: 70%

### 9. Next Steps for Full Execution

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install` ✅
2. **Run full test suite**: `npm test`
3. **Generate coverage report**: `npm run test:coverage`
4. **Review failing tests**: Fix any import/path issues
5. **Continuous Integration**: Add to CI/CD pipeline

### 10. Key Files to Monitor

Critical files for accuracy testing:
- `src/lib/structuredDecisionModel.js` - WDM implementation
- `src/lib/purchaseClassifier.js` - Purchase categorization
- `src/components/ProgressiveFinancialProfile.js` - User input & calculations
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - API integration
