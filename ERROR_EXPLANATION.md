# Error Explanation

## The Error

```
Error: Cannot find module './276.js'
```

## What It Means

This is a **Next.js build cache corruption error**. It happens when webpack (the build tool Next.js uses) tries to load module chunks that have been corrupted or deleted from the `.next` directory.

## Why It Happens

1. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** - When you save files, Next.js tries to update only the changed parts. Sometimes this process goes wrong
2. **Interrupted builds** - If the dev server restarts unexpectedly during compilation
3. **Corrupted cache files** - The `.next` directory can get corrupted over time

## The Solution

The fix is simple: **Delete the `.next` directory and restart the server**

```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

This forces Next.js to rebuild everything from scratch, clearing any corrupted cache.

## Prevention

- Always stop the dev server properly (Ctrl+C) before making major changes
- If you see this error repeatedly, consider running `npm run build` to ensure everything compiles correctly
- The error is harmless and doesn't indicate any problems with your actual code

## Status

âœ… Fixed by clearing cache and restarting server
